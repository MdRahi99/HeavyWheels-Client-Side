                There are four main types of state you need to properly manage
                in your React apps:
              </h3>
              <li>
                Local (UI) state: Local state is data we manage in one or
                another component.
              </li>
              <li>
                Global (UI) state: Global state is data we manage across
                multiple components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server state: Data that comes from an external server that must
                be integrated with our UI state.
              </li>
              <li>
                URL state: Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname
                and query parameters.
              </li>

              How does prototypical inheritance work?

            <div className="">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
                The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to
                add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which
                an object can inherit the properties and methods of another
                object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]]
                of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
            </h2>
            <div className="">
              <h3 className="text-xl mb-3">
                The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
                test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
                important step in the development process, because if done
                correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
                more difficult to find in later testing stages. <br /> <br />{" "}
                They enable you to catch bugs early in the development process.
                Automated unit tests help a great deal with regression testing.
                They detect code smells in your codebase. For example, if you're
                having a hard time writing unit tests for a piece of code, it
                might be a sign that your function is too complex.

                <p>
                  React is based on JavaScript, but it’s mostly combined with
                  JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows you to
                  create elements that contain HTML and JavaScript at the same
                  time.Anything you create with JSX could also be created with
                  the React JavaScript API.

                  Angular:
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Services in Angular are used by Components to delegate
                  business-logic tasks such as fetching data or validating
                  input. They are a distinct part of Angular applications. While
                  Angular doesn’t enforce their use, it’s highly suggested to
                  structure apps as a set of distinct services.

                <p>
                  The Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. It’s
                  called a progressive framework because you can extend its
                  functionality with official and third-party packages, such as
                  Vue Router or Vuex, to turn it into an actual
                  framework.Although Vue is not strictly associated with the
                  MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
